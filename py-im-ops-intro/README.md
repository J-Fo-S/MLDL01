### py-im-ops-intro

Before we go anywhere near machine or deep learning, we have some familiarizing to do with Python and some of its core packages. In particular, we'll need to operate with various types of data for a variety of processing tasks that one often encounters in machine and deep learning. 

*Note that we are using the term **familiarity**, and not something like "mastery".* There are 2 points: 1 is that you will get better as you practice, so be patient with yourself if you don't understand all at once. Taken together with our immersion into such large and experimental fields as machine and deep learning, understanding all at once is probably impossible.

The 2nd point is that most of the machine and deep learning code we will be working with are pre-programmed and will run. So we don't have to write anything from scratch (that would actually be very advanced). Instead, our goal is to begin to understand each part of these large programs 1 by 1, and how we may work with and modify the programming for our goals. In time, we'll be able to understand the entire system. For now, we'll go piece-by-piece.

The programs here are intended in the following order:
1. py-gen-ops-intro
2. np-plt-img-intro
3. seam-carve

### Tasks
1. Write a function that returns the result of a basic math formula to a variable
2. Write a function that returns a different result depending if its argument is greater or less than some value, and throws an error if the argument is a string
3. Write a function that prints returns a list of the letters of a string one by one
4. Write a function that scrambles the the lines of poem.txt and saves it as a newly named txt file.
