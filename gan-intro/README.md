### toy_gan_tutorial

try:
1. Implement tensorboard
2. Compare performance (visually and in tensorboard) with and without random "seeding"
3. Compare performance with different parameter values
4. Design a more challenging target (e.g. more complex shape and/or more data points) and note the performance

### gan_mnist_ex

try:
1. Implement tensorboard (yes always..)
2. Compare performance with Fashion-MNISt and Google Quickdraw datasets
3. Implement 3-dimensional data, such as CIFAR-10
4. Implement convolutional layer and compare performance

### DC-gan

try:
1. Implement all of the usual tools and datasets
2. Implement 3-dimensional data
3. Implement weight visualization
