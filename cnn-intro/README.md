### cnn-intro

For this session and the rest, we are firmly in the territory of deep learning. The most general difference between deep learning and machine learning is the size, width and depth of the networks. As the name suggests, deep networks are, well, deeper networks than machine learning networks are. They feature many **"hidden layers"** (we've already done this when we had more than one layer). Deep learning models have been more successful than machine learning models at learning more challenging datasets (e.g. labeling 1000s of categories). However, there is a catch - they take far longer to train and will perform far slower than their ML cousins. The trade-off between accuracy and performance (speed) is always an issue.



try:
1. Implement tensorboard
2. Change convolutional layers parameters and document performance results
3. Implement fashionMNIST - which of our 3 datasets is the most challenging for our model?
4. Add additional convolutional layers
