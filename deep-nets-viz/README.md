â€‹In this session, we'll take (another) great leap - this time into some of the most popular and best performing models available to the public. It would take a PhD to understand it all, so we will focus on a specific objective - how can we visualize what these models are learning?
To do so, we will dive deep into the many hidden layers of models such as Googles Inception. By utilizing some clever techniques, we can find out what these models learn at different layers. The results are often quite interesting and the potential quite exciting. Possibilities abound, and the code awaits..
